     <h1> Education </h1>
     <p> I am going to talk to you about my education now. </p>
     <p> My very first school was Carden Academy which I was there for about two years. Then I went to Blue Hills for five years. After Blue Hills, I am now in Miller Middle School. I will be there for about two more years after this one. The for high school I will be in Lynbrook.  My dream collage is to get in to Standford or UC Berckly. </p>
